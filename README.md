# What is this application?
Delisyok is a web application that is focused on running a food delivering business. However, if you access the page right now, it might seem empty. That's not a bug, it's a feature **(no serious, legit, it's a feature)**, as this is a part of a group work for a university project.

# What is this developed on?
We run on mostly [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) as our main framework, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as our CSS "framework", [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as our backend, and deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
